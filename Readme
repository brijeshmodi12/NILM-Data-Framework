Steps for Preprocessing:

1. Run ConvertToH5.py
    This reads raw datasets from diverse formats into standard BaseNILMDataset class.
    - Currently contains wrappers for REFIT and UKDale Dataset
    - No data resampling occurs during this conversion
    

2. Run ConvertToTensor.py
    This converts the H5 files into tensors for training.
    - Users can resample data to desired sampling rate for uniformity across datasets
    - Users are required set desired seq_len, overlap during conversion.
